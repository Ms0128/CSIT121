		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>A dive into the enigma that is my mind!</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Michael Steinberg and I am currently in CCBC studying towards a Bachelors in IT. I work as a technical support engineer with CallTrackingMetrics which has been an amazing experience so far. I have a small dog that I absolutely love to death and can't live without, her name is Miley! I've had her for almost 3 years now even though it feels like just yesterday I was holding her in my palms. Some of my favorite hobbies include building LEGOS, learning about new software/programs, playing video games, building PCs while researching new computer componenets that just released, and exploring nature. If you ever want to chat about my favorite things or hobbies, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:warcraftdudeman@gmail.com">warcraftdudeman@gmail.com</a>. Thanks for stopping by and visiting my web page!</p>
