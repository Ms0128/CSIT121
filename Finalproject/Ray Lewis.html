<p>In 2001, Ray Lewis had won his first Defensive Player of the Year award, which is awarded to the best player on the defensive side of the football in the entire league. In 2003, he followed his 2001 year with another DPOY award and also led the league in tackles with 163. Finally, his 2012 year was remakrable since he had been injured mid year, thought to have been done for good, then came back in the playoffs and led the Ravens to their second Super bowl championship. This was a true riding off into the sunset experience.
