		<h1>Ed Reed</h1>
		<h2>The Ball Hawk</h2>
		<p>Ed Reed had a long and successful career with the Baltimore Ravens. On the field, he was one of the best safeties of all time, and he helped lead the Ravens to a Super Bowl victory in 2013. He was also a nine-time Pro Bowler and a five-time First-Team All-Pro. Off the field, Reed was known for his charitable work and his commitment to giving back to the community. He was named the NFL's Man of the Year in 2010, and he has continued to be an active philanthropist even after retiring from football. In addition to his on-field and off-field accomplishments, Ed Reed was also known for his leadership and his ability to inspire his teammates. He was a key part of the Ravens' defense for many years, and his impact on the team was felt both on and off the field.</p>

<p>In 2001, Ray Lewis had won his first Defensive Player of the Year award, which is awarded to the best player on the defensive side of the football in the entire league. In 2003, he followed his 2001 year with another DPOY award and also led the league in tackles with 163. Finally, his 2012 year was remakrable since he had been injured mid year, thought to have been done for good, then came back in the playoffs and led the Ravens to their second Super bowl championship. This was a true riding off into the sunset experience.
