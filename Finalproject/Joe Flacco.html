<p>Jonathan Ogden had an outstanding career with the Baltimore Ravens, but his three most notable seasons would have to be 2000, 2003, and 2006. In 2000, Ogden was a key part of the Ravens' Super Bowl-winning team, as he helped protect quarterback Trent Dilfer and open up running lanes for the offense. In 2003, he was named the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year, and helped lead the Ravens to a 10-6 record. In 2006, he was once again named to the Pro Bowl, and helped anchor an offensive line that allowed the fewest sacks in the league.
